            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The TimeMelt Extension requires access to certain browser permissions to function effectively. We collect the following types of information directly from your browser's local storage and active tabs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Spent Data:</strong> We track the time you spend on websites that you have defined as "time-wasters" within the Extension. This data includes the domain name of the website and the duration of your activity on it. This information is processed and stored <strong>solely locally on your device</strong> within your browser's storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitored Website List:</strong> The list of websites you choose to monitor for time tracking is stored <strong>solely locally on your device</strong> within your browser's storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Tab Information:</strong> To accurately track time spent on websites, the Extension needs to access information about your currently active browser tabs (e.g., the URL of the active tab). This information is processed in real-time and used solely for the purpose of time tracking. <strong>We do not store your Browse history or transmit this information to external servers or any third parties.</strong></li>
            </ul>

                <li>To generate visual reports (e.g., pie charts) and lists summarizing your time spent on websites.</li>
                <li>To enable you to customize the list of websites you wish to monitor.</li>
